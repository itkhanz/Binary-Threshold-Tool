# Binary Threshold Tool
This tool lets you load the image from disc, converts it into grayscale and display the image. It also enables to apply the simple binary thresholding to image and dynamically adjust the threshold value. This project uses the Python 3.7 with OpenCV, PIL(photo imaging Library) and Tkinter libraries.
The requirements file is added to install all the additional dependencies for Python. The dependencies can be installed by typing-in pip install -r requirements.txt in the command line.
