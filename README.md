# Binary Threshold Tool
This tool lets the user load the image from disc and display it onto the screen. It can also dislay the image in grayscale. It also enables to apply the simple binary thresholding to image and dynamically adjust the threshold value.  This tool is developed in Python (version 3.7) with OpenCV, NumPy, PIL(photo imaging Library) and Tkinter GUI libraries.
## Dependencies
The requirements file facilitates to install all the additional dependencies for Python.The dependencies can be installed by typing-in **_pip install -r requirements.txt_** in the command line.  Follow the steps to interact with the tool:
* Press **Select an image** button to load image from the disc and display.
* Press **Show Grayscale** button to display the grayscale image.
* **Slide** to adjust the binary threshold value and observe the output image.
* Above steps can be repeated to analyze another image.
